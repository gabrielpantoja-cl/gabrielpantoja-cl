# Gabriel Pantoja | Full-Stack Developer specializing in PropTech & Real Estate Data

### About Me

With over a decade of experience as a Real Estate Appraiser in Chile, I witnessed firsthand how valuable public data becomes fragmented and inaccessible, often trapped in countless spreadsheets and difficult-to-access public records. This challenge drove my transition into web development.

Today, I build the tools I wish I had: data-driven, transparent, and efficient PropTech solutions. My goal is to empower real estate professionals and bring clarity to the market through technology.
